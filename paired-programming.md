# Paired programming: ``sproc``

### Goal
It is clear to me from the proposal.md that ``sproc`` is trying to gather occurrence data of two taxa from the GBIF database and visualize the ranges and the extent of overlap of both through heat maps.

The list of dependencies needed to run this program is included in the README.md file.
One of the main packages used in this program is the ``pygbif`` project as well as its various modules e.g. ``species`` and ``occurrences`` to query data from the database. 

### Data
The data for this project is occurrence data from the GBIF REST API database. The dataframe includes columns for species name and latitude and longtitude coordinates.

### Code
The current code has a proper skeleton and is organized into the sproc.py and utils.py files, the first consisting of a Class object mainly for the retrieval of occurrence data from the GBIF database, and the latter being a utils file for generating plots and performing calculations.

It can query occurrence data for a specific species and produce various maps using defined polygons.

In the sproc.py file, the Class object *Sproc* includes functions such as *__init__*, *get_gbif_occs* and *run* that altogether allow the occurrence data to be queried.
In the utils.py file, there are functions such as *hexmap*, *recmap*, and *kdemap* that can be used to generate maps where occurrence data are represented by different polygons.  

### Code contributions/ideas

Since I don't have a lot of experience coding, I'm including links and sources that may be useful for plotting occurrence data on maps.

I found out that the Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER geographic database has the cartographic boundary files in shapefile format for USA map by state and by county. If you are trying to show occurrence at a finer resolution, this may be useful.
This link shows somes example codes: https://melaniesoek0120.medium.com/data-visualization-how-to-plot-a-map-with-geopandas-in-python-73b10dcd4b4b
Cartographic boundary files: https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/carto-boundary-file.html.

Also, rather than showing occurrence data as polygons. I was wondering if you have considered visualizing them using ``pointplots``.

Alternatively, the geoplot.kdeplot may be a good way to show the heat maps.

I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help in turns of contributing to the actual code.
